## Core Contribution
LLM-guided transcript interpretation for editing actions. Instead of simple word deletions, the LLM understands "remove the repetitive intro" or "keep only the funny parts" and maps them to timestamped edits.

## Relevance to Project
Directly supports extending our simple rule-based text operations toward intent-aware editing in the `vibe.py` router.
